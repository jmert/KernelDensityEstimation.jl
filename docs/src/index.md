## Why another kernel density estimation package?

As of Nov 2024, much of the Julia ecosystem uses the
[`KernelDensity.jl`](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/KernelDensity)
package (possibly implicitly, such as through density plots in Makie.jl, StatsPlots.jl, etc).

...

```@example example_truncate
using Random
Random.seed!(1234)  # hide

# A vector of Gaussian random deviates
rv_gauss = randn(500)
# and its expected distribution
x = -5.0:0.01:5.0
exp_gauss = @. exp(-x^2 / 2) / sqrt(2π)

# Then filter the random deviates to be strictly positive
rv_trunc = filter(>(0.0), rv_gauss)
# and its corresponding distribution (×2 to keep normalization)
exp_trunc = @. ifelse(x > 0.0, 2exp_gauss, 0.0)
nothing  # hide
```

    ```@example example_truncate
    using CairoMakie

    function draw_KD(grid, rv, (x, exp_dist), (z, kde_dist), title)
        ax = Axis(grid, title = title)
        # draw the reference expectation distribution
        lines!(ax, x, exp_dist, linestyle = :dash, color = :black)
        # draw the kernel density estimate
        lines!(ax, z, kde_dist, linewidth = 2, color = Cycled(1))

        # add a shadow axis and marks along the bottom edge to indicate
        # the location of the random deviates
        ax2 = Axis(grid, limits = (nothing, (0.0, 1.0)))
        vlines!(ax2, rv, ymin=0.0, ymax=0.03, linewidth = 0.5, color = (:black, 0.2))
        hidedecorations!(ax2)
        hidespines!(ax2)
        linkxaxes!(ax2, ax)

        # fix the range of the axes
        xlims!(ax2, -5.9, 5.9)
    end
    nothing  # hide
    ```

If we then plot the outputs of running the `KernelDensity.kde` method on each of these two vectors:

```@example example_truncate
import KernelDensity as KD

kd_gauss = KD.kde(rv_gauss)
kd_trunc = KD.kde(rv_trunc)
nothing  # hide
```

    ```@example example_truncate
    fig = Figure(size = (800, 400))

    # Gaussian distribution & KDE
    ref = (x, exp_gauss)
    kd = (kd_gauss.x, kd_gauss.density)
    draw_KD(fig[1, 1], rv_gauss, ref, kd, "Gaussian")

    # Truncation Gaussian distribution & KDE
    ref = (x, exp_trunc)
    kd = (kd_trunc.x, kd_trunc.density)
    draw_KD(fig[1, 2], rv_trunc, ref, kd, "Truncated Gaussian")

    Label(fig[0, :], "KernelDensity.jl", font = :bold, fontsize = 20)

    save("example_kerneldensity.svg", fig)  # hide
    nothing  # hide
    ```

For the Gaussian distribution (left) where there are no edges, the density estimate appears to be a reasonable
approximation of the known Gaussian distribution.
In comparison, though, the truncated Gaussian distribution (right) fails to represent the hard cut-off at ``x = 0``,
instead "leaking" below zero with non-zero density despite the known closed boundary.

Closed boundaries are common among many probability distributions,[^bounded] and therefore the need to estimate a
density corresponding to a (semi-)bounded distribution arises often.
This package provides a density estimator that uses any provided boundary conditions to account for edge boundary
effects, reproducing a more faithful representation of the underlying distribution.

[^bounded]: For example, see the list of distributions with
    [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions#Supported_on_a_bounded_interval)
    and
    [semi-infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions#Supported_on_semi-infinite_intervals,_usually_[0,%E2%88%9E%29)
    support on Wikipedia.

Repeating the density estimation on the Gaussian and truncated Gaussian distributions shown above instead with this
package's [`kde`](@ref) method:

```@example example_truncate
import KernelDensityEstimation as KDE

kde_gauss = KDE.kde(rv_gauss)
kde_trunc = KDE.kde(rv_trunc, lo = 0.0, boundary = :closedleft)
nothing  # hide
```
