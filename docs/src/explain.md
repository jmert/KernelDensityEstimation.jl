## Estimator Pipeline

### Direct Comparisons

The following figures provide direct comparisons of the four major steps in the estimator pipeline described above
through their visual impact on a few example distributions.

1. _LinearBinning_: The data is histogrammed onto a uniformly spaced grid.

   For visualization purposes, the histograms are plotted with bins with a width equal to the automatically determined
   bandwidth (see [Bandwidth Estimators](#Bandwidth-Estimators) below) for the distribution, whereas the remaining
   panels use 8Ã— as many data points to achieve a smoother curve.

2. _BasicKDE_: This step convolves with the histogram with the Gaussian kernel in order to smooth the data from a
   discontinuous histogram into a smooth curve.

   The basic density estimator is sufficient for an unbounded and smooth distribution like the **Normal** case.
   In the cases of the **HalfNormal** and **Uniform** distributions that have non-zero boundaries, though, the
   distribution is severely underestimated near the boundaries.

3. _LinearBoundaryKDE_: This step corrects for the boundary effects by recovering both the normalization (due to
   convolving with implicit zeros beyond the boundary) and recovers the slope of the distribution near boundaries.

   Compared to the BasicKDE step, the **HalfNormal** and **Uniform** distributions near their boundaries are
   significantly improved.

4. _MultiplicativeBiasKDE_: The final stage permits use of a larger bandwidth to achieve a smoother density estimate
   without sacrificing the sharpness of any curves / peaks.
   The algorithm automatically increases the bandwidth when the multiplicative bias correction is used.

   The visual impact is more subtle than in previous stages, but the smoothness of the **Uniform** and **Chisq3**
   distributions compared to the previous stage are a consequence of the multiplicative bias correction permitting
   a larger kernel bandwidth (without broadening the peak in the **Chisq3** distribution).
